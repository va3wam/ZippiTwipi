# ZippiTwipi
This repository contains all of the information regarding a DC motor based two wheeled inverted pendulum robot experimental platform. This initiative is running in parallel with the TWIPi repository.

## Motors & Controller
The motor controller and DC motors being used were scavaged from a balancing robot project that was abandoned a number of years ago. This gear can still be purchased today here: https://robot-electronics.co.uk/md25-12v-2-8a-dual-h-bridge.html
