This repository contains the Arduino source code that runs on an embedded processor at the heart of the six legged robot we call HexBot. The goals of this project can be found [here](goals.md). 

# State of things

This is an ongoing experimental platform. Testing has shown that the level of control over the DC motors using the MD25 controller
via I2C may not be sufficiently refined for what we think is required for balancing on two wheels. Also note that the use of the 
amMD25 and MD25 libraries is being phased ut in favour of using the mobility.h include file.

# Getting Started

This project requires that you have a Hexbot robot. The Robot is made up of a custom robot chassis and PCB as well as the code in this repository. Without a version 3 or later Hexbot robot this code will not be very useful to you.

## Hexbot Developers Guide

### Prerequisites

In order to make use of the code in this repository you will require the following items.

* A Hexbot robot made up of [this hardware](/docs/hexbotHardware.md).
* The [Hexbot custom PCB](/docs/hexbotCircuit.md).
* An [MQTT broker](/docs/MQTTbroker.md) used by the robot's [MQTT web interface](/docs/hexbotWebInterface.md).  
* A [clone](/docs/cloneRepository.md) of the Hexbot gitHub repository into your own local Git repository.

### Development Software Stack

* How to [clone](/docs/cloneRepository.md) the Hexbot gitHub repository.
* Sample [platformio.ini](AA/platformIO-MAC-example.txt) template.
* Set up [PlatformIO](https://github.com/va3wam/hexBot/blob/main/docs/cloneRepository.md#set-up-platformio).
* Recommended Visual Studio Code [plugins](https://github.com/va3wam/hexBot/blob/main/docs/cloneRepository.md#visual-studio-code-plugins).

### Code Compatability

Hexbot software runs as a monolithic firmware image. The high level logic and peripheral interactions are handled using Arduino C++. FreeRTOS is used to run a WiFi stack as well as the primitive xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() which is used to manage mutli-threaded process execution.

Hexbot's firmware is intended to run on the Espressif ESP WROOM32 "Software On a Chip" (SOC). The development board used for this SOC is the [Zerynth DOIT Esp32 DevKit v1](https://testzdoc.zerynth.com/reference/boards/doit_esp32/docs/). ```We may be switching to a different board``` Note that some standard Arduino functions such as AnalogWrite() have not been implemented on the ESP32 SOC and alternate functions such as ledcSetup(), ledcAttachPin() and ledcWrite() must be used in their place. There are some additional compatability issues of note as follows:

* The GPIO pin usage is loosey Adafruit featherboard compliant meaning it will work with some boards such as the Adafruit OLED featherboard.
* This code will NOT run on an ESP8266 unmodified because of both GPIO incompatability as well as some ESP32 specific libraries that are in use.

### Installing

A set of instructions on how to install the source code for VA3WAM projects can be found [here](https://va3wam.github.io/versionControl/).

### Testing

At this time we have no tools or standards for automated testing of Arduino code on an embedded system. 

### Deployment

Use serial over USB to load the inital code onto the embedded system. Subsequent builds can be uploaded using either serial over USB or 
a [OTA web interface](/docs/webOTA.md) hosted by the robot which allows you to do [OTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming) updates.

### Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text editor.
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - IDE for ESP32 based Arduino development.

# Kinematic Model

Hexbot uses an inverse kinematic model to manipulate it's legs. To learn more about our implementation of an inverse kinematic model look <a href="/docs/kinematicModel.md">here</a>.
